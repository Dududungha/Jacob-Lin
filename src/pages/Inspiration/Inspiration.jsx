                    <p>A mental health wellness resource with a focus on the internet generation that started as a small Twitch channel where <a href="https://www.healthygamer.gg/dr-alok-kanojia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dr. Alok Kanojia</a> streamed and shared his thoughts on mental health. Not only is it a place to get help, but it has a great community of people dedicated to providing help and getting people started on their journeys. This has personally been a great inspiration for me, drawing from the amazing community, and being a part of their AoE {'('}Area of effect{')'} healing. Iâ€™m always on the path to improving myself, and finding ways to help others, and Healthy Gamer has taught me so much about both.</p>

                    <p>He is a content creator that I love and admire, and he is one of the role models that I aspire to be. Comedic, witty, and sometimes harsh on the outside, but sincere, caring, and thoughtful at all times. I know it is quite idealized, but how bad is it to chase ideals?</p>

                    <p>My Brother, Sam Lin, has been my role model all throughout my life. Being ten years older than I am, he has experienced all that I will experience and always has so much relevant advice to offer. There was never a time where I felt that I was in the shadow of my brother, because he always made the effort to help me be successful.</p>

                    <p>Okay, I know how this looks, but bear with me. This has nothing to do with the story of the show and how that turned out, because it has everything to do with the concept of the show. The concept of putting on a helmet and having your consciousness be transported into a whole other world was just so awesome to impressionable young me and since then, my dream has been to create that experience. </p>

                    <p>This is more of a story of how I inspired myself. Sekiro is a game made by developers known for making notoriously hard games. However, instead of being scared of the challenge, I welcomed it and applied myself to completing the game. Eventually, after many hours, and much practice, I was able to complete the game not just once, but twice on different story paths. This stands as proof that I can accomplish anything that I set my mind to, and this often inspires me to work and put effort in.</p>
