                <p>For all of my second year (the 2021-22 school year) at UCSD, I enjoyed working part time as a tutor for the CSE 8A and CSE 12 courses taught by Professor <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/people/faculty-profiles/paul-cao" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Paul Cao</a>. Being a tutor certainly has been an amazingly rewarding experience, and I feel it especially in the moments where I see the students’ eyes light up with understanding. It is so fulfilling to know that I was able to help someone in that moment and it is a source of great inspiration to keep going. I have been and will continue to be really grateful to have this opportunity to help others and am glad to have put several hours every week towards this end. Every week, I am reminded to be more thoughtful and open minded, to be kind and helpful no matter how I feel that day, and I believe that this has really helped me grow.</p>
