                <p>The TCHS Peer Listeners program was established to create a safe space where students can communicate their feelings freely. It is an innovative program where students learn to help each other with their mental and emotional health. I was fortunate enough to be picked to be a part of this program as a Peer Listener, and be trained to help other students with their stresses. I was taught to actively listen, to ask questions for clarification as well as to show that I understand, and how to mediate conflicts. I’m glad that I was a part of the program and learned these important skills that I find myself using everyday, in every conversation. It has helped me understand others and become a more kind, and thoughtful person. </p>
