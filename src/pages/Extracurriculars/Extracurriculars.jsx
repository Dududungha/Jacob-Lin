                <p>The Association for Computing Machinery at UCSD is a student organization founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyhuongnguyen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emily Nguyen</a> with a focus on creating a members first community for anyone interested in computing. I joined ACM in 2020 precisely because of this wonderful community and my experience here has greatly shaped my college career. I have had the privilege of being a part of the Membership Team as the bit-byte director for the 2021-2022 school year, and will be continuing in the team as the Vice President of Membership for the 2022-2023 school year!</p>
