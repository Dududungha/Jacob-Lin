                <ul>
                    <li>Developed and designed the frontend of the website using React.js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create intuitive and necessary components giving the website a clean and concise finished look</li>
                    <li>Collected and analyzed data from a survey 40+ participants, supplemented with online data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A website that compiles my team’s research on the orthography, phonology, semantics, and social perception of a form of text and speech that we dubbed the "uwu register". My main part in this project was creating the frontend for the website by realizing the designs that the designer had come up with. I had a lot of fun learning how to style the page using CSS and customizing the imported components from Ant Design. It’s crazy to me how such a silly topic and part of internet culture became one of my favorite projects and one of the projects that I learned the most from. This is just proof that it is much more worth it to have fun while working.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Developed in Android Studio using the AGILE software engineering practice with a team of six and demoed to 20+ "customers"</li>
                    <li>Created the location tracking backend to create more accurate routes by using the Location API in Android Studio</li>
                    <p>Imagine going to the San Diego Zoo, excited to see all the cute animals, only to be lost and looking at the map for the whole time. And trying to figure out how to best visit all the animals is too hard! To solve this problem, we made ZooSeeker, an android app that takes the list of animals you want to visit in the San Diego Zoo and figures out the best route to take from your location and gives you directions through each step! This is the project from a software engineering course that I took at UCSD and I learned much about the software development process and good software design practices through this project!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hosted over 200+ forums for hobby sharing by building an interactive frontend with React.js</li>
                    <li>Built the homepage to iteratively display hobbies in separate categories and iteratively linked each hobby to its own page using custom components and react props.</li>
                    <p>My very first project working with a team in ACM at UCSD. This was my introduction to web development and frontend development using the MERN tech stack. Though I didn’t know it at the time, I was being taught bits of the software development process such as the planning board and separating the project into tasks. If I hadn’t done this first project, I would still be apprehensive about starting, and intimidated by the mystery of software development. I’m glad I was able to take that first step, dip my toes into this amazing field and now I’m excited to see where I can go and what I can learn.</p>
