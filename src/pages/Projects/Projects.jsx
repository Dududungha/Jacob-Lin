                <p>A website that compiles my teamâ€™s research on the orthography, phonology, semantics, and social perception of a form of text and speech that we dubbed the "uwu register". My main part in this project was creating the frontend for the website by realizing the designs that the designer had come up with. I had a lot of fun learning how to style the page and customizing the imported components from <a href="https://ant.design/docs/spec/introduce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ant Design</a>.</p>
