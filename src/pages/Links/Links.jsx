                <p>The Association for Computing Machinery at UCSD is a student organization founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyhuongnguyen/">Emily Nguyen</a> with a focus on creating a members first community for anyone interested in computing. I joined ACM in 2020 precisely because of this wonderful community and my experience here has greatly shaped my college career. I have had the priviledge of being a part of the Membership Team as the bit-byte director for the 2021-2022 school year, and will be continuing in the team as the Vice President of Membership for the 2022-2023 school year!</p>

                <p>A website that compiles my teamâ€™s research on the orthography, phonology, semantics, and social perception of a form of text and speech that we dubbed the "uwu register". My main part in this project was creating the frontend for the website by realizing the designs that the designer had come up with. I had a lot of fun learning how to style the page and customizing the imported components from <a href="https://ant.design/docs/spec/introduce">Ant Design</a>.</p>
