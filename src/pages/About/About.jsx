            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey! I'm Jacob Lin. I'm currently in my second year studying Computer Science at University of California - San Diego. I'm still exploring where I want to go with Computer Science, but I would especially love to work in Virtual Reality (just thinking about where this could go gets me so excited!). Currently I have the most experience with frontend work in web and app development. Beyond that, Iâ€™ve been a part of the Association for Computing Machinery at UCSD as their Bit-Byte director and as the Vice President Membership, and it has been such a treat organizing events and working with my team to create a comfortable space for anyone interested in computing.</p>
